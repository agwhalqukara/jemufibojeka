Jordan</h1><div id=sub-header>July 2024 · 6 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p><strong>Jordan is an American who came to public recognition for being the husband of Moriah Elizabeth, an American YouTuber popular for posting squishy toy videos and DIY craft vlogs on her self-titled YouTube channel.</strong></p><p>While some people come into the limelight via their successful careers, others do the same as a result of their relationship with one who is already in the spotlight. Jordan, who finds himself in the latter category, only came into the news following his marriage to the YouTuber star. Read on to learn about him and his marital life with Elizabeth Moriah.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Jordan’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><b>Full name: </b>Jordan</li><li><b>Gender: </b>Male</li><li><b>Ethnicity: </b>White</li><li><b>Nationality:</b> American</li><li><b>Sexual Orientation: </b>Straight</li><li><b>Religion: </b>Christianity</li><li><b>Marital Status: </b>Married</li><li><b><strong>Jordan</strong>’s Wife: </b>Elizabeth Moriah</li><li><b><strong>Jordan</strong>’s Children: </b>A daughter</li><li><b>Famous for: </b>Being Elizabeth Moriah’s husband</li></ul><h2><strong>Jordan is an American Citizen</strong></h2><p>Moriah Elizabeth’s husband, Jordan, was born in the United States of America and is an American national. There is no information about his date and year of birth on the internet, so we cannot state how old he is at the moment. Meanwhile, his wife Moriah was born in California on the 14th of November 1994 and is currently 29 years old.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/mo.png><p>Similarly, we do not have any available information about Jordan’s family background, parents, or siblings, as well as details of his educational qualifications and the schools he attended. Jordan is a very private person; consequently, a lot of details about him are scarce in the media.</p><h2><strong>Jordan Has Been Moriah Elizabeth’s Husband for 10 Years</strong></h2><p>Jordan is happily married to Moriah Elizabeth, and their marriage has lasted for 10 years. Moriah first revealed that she is married to Jordan in a Q&A video session she granted on her YouTube channel on 10th September 2018. Many of her fans seemed shocked about her revelation because that was the very first time it came to public knowledge that she was a married woman.</p><p>Meanwhile, the couple met for the first time in 2014 when Moriah was only ten years old. There is no record to show where they met, but Moriah was unarguably still in junior school then, so it might possibly be that they attended the same school. They became friends at that time and subsequently started dating.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/Jordan-and-his-wife-Moriah.png><p>The love birds were together for nine years before they eventually decided to get married in 2013. That means Moriah got married to Jordan when she was 19 years old, and they have since remained together in marriage for 10 years now.</p><p>The timeline of their relationship within those nine years of dating and the kind of wedding ceremony they had is not public knowledge. It is apparent that the couple decides to completely keep their love and family life away from the public eye.</p><h2><strong>What Does Moriah Elizabeth’s Husband Do For a Living?</strong></h2><p>It is still unclear what Moriah Elizabeth’s husband does for a living or what his profession is. But we only recognize that he occasionally features in some of Moriah’s YouTube videos. As we mentioned earlier, Jordan came to public recognition after Moriah introduced him on social media as her husband.</p><p>Since then, many people have been on the search to know more about the celebrity husband, especially in regard to his personal and career life. However, from what is obvious, Jordan is not a public person. Even after the YouTube star announced him as her husband, Jordan still does not have any interest in staying active in the media space.</p><h3><strong>Jordan Occasionally Features in Moriah’s YouTube Videos</strong></h3><p>Before she announced that they were married, Jordan had occasionally been seen in some of Moriah’s early YouTube videos. It was in one of the videos that she first introduced him to her fans as his friend. “His name is Jordan. He has been on the camera in the past, I’ll show you a couple of clips of him and me when we were teenagers…”, part of her introduction reads.</p><p>Jordan appeared in one of the videos posted in 2012 titled “Worst Things to Say to a Girl,” and Moriah stated in the description that they had to rehearse for half an hour before filming because he was very camera shy. Some of her other videos wherein she featured her husband include 11 Ways to Break Up&nbsp;and How to Get a Guy to Like You, among others.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the Q&A session, the DIY crafts artist was asked when she will make a proper video with her husband, and she answered, “probably on his own time, though.” Despite the fact that she features Jordan in some of her videos, information about him still remains scarce in the media. They strictly do not publicly share their personal and marriage details.</p><h3><strong>Their Marriage is Blessed with a Daughter</strong></h3><p>Moriah and her husband Jordan share one child, a daughter. Just like she announced her marriage, Moriah also shocked her fans with the news of her baby. In July 2022, the YouTube star in one of her videos shared that she and her husband have a 10-month-old daughter. Going by the detail, the baby was born around October 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/Jordans-wife-and-daughter.png><p>However, Moriah said that she is not sure if she would ever reveal the name of her baby or post the photos in the media. Her major reason is that she wants to respect her baby’s privacy regardless of the fact that she herself is in the limelight. However, she eventually posted the baby’s photo but did not reveal her name yet.</p><h3><strong>Moriah Elizabeth is Famous For Being a YouTuber and Craft Artist</strong></h3><p>Moriah Elizabeth is a YouTube star, content creator, author, and entrepreneur well known for her craft and DIY videos on her self-titled YouTube channel where she has about 8 million followers. Elizabeth obtained a degree in Graphic Designing from a private university in California.</p><p>She joined YouTube upon graduation and launched Wreck This Journal, a YouTube series that turned her into a YouTube star in just a while. In addition to her thriving YouTube career, Moriah owns and runs a fashion company that deals in all kinds of hoodies, T-shirts, and backpacks.</p><p>She is also passionate about singing and dancing and showcases her dancing skills on her online platforms, including TikTok and YouTube. The internet sensation is also popular for making squishy toys as well as arts and crafts videos for kids. She runs a publication of an art journal called “Create This Book” and has successfully published three volumes of it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmmqScYq6ju9StZKanop6uqXnEpaCzmZKawam%2FjKGsrJqRo7Futs6rm5qmXw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./bert-kreischer-net-worth-in-2023.html>&#171;&nbsp;Bert Kreischer Net Worth in 2023</a>
