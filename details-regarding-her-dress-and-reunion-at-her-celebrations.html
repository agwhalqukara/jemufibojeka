Although ex-lovers reunited for Alexa's birthday celebration, including Cole Barnett and Zanab Jaffrey, her dress, worth $525 (£432), was the center of attention.</strong></p><p>The first four episodes of the third season of the popular reality series <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Love Is Blind</strong></a> on <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Netflix</strong></a> have just been released, and it's understandable why people are outraged. If you're not familiar with the show, it follows 30 singles as they enter pods to communicate and fall in love via a wall. Eventually, people fall in love and make the decision to get engaged before ever meeting. After that, the couples venture out into the outside world to try to work things out. They have a few weeks to determine if they want to get married or not.</p><p>It is a unique dating program that challenges the idea of romance as we know it. The program invites several young people to participate in a social experiment where they can go on dates with a variety of potential partners and, ideally, find true love. The Netflix dating reality series Love Is Blind, hosted by <strong>Vanessa</strong> and <strong>Nick Lachey</strong>, challenges the fundamental idea of love. It does accept a diverse mix of men and women (from a specific city each season) and provides them with the chance to develop closer relationships.</p><p>When a couple becomes engaged, they go on dates with each other before beginning to make wedding plans. The third season of the reality show hoped to welcome many individuals who would discover their mate through the experiment.</p><p>The recent episodes of Love Is Blind focused on <strong>Alexa Lemieux</strong>'s birthday party, to which ex-lover contestants were invited and were seen having fun. As her birthday has been the topic of gossip, her dress is not less relevant. So let's get into the specifics of her birthday celebrations.</p><p>Previously we talked about <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Colleen's Ballet Dance</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Colleen being annoying</strong></a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Raven Ross Plastic Surgery</strong></a>.</p><h2>Alexa Lemieux’s 28th Birthday Celebration Had a Reunion of Cole Barnett and Zanab Jaffrey, and Her Dress, Worth $525 (£432), Was the Center of Attention!</h2><p>During the upcoming After The Altar episodes, <strong>Alexa Lemieux</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@mrsalexalemieux</a>) and the rest of the season 3 cast will be revisited by Love is Blind Alex's birthday party. Ex-lovers reunite for Alexa's birthday celebration, including <strong>Cole Barnett</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@colebarnett</a>) and <strong>Zanab Jaffrey </strong>(<a href=# rel=noopener>@zanabjaffrey</a>). Let's discuss her birthday party in more depth.</p><p>When asked if Zanab registered her somewhere for her birthday during the Appreciation is Blind episodes, Alexa Lemieux responds that she likes diamonds, demonstrating her apparent love of the finest things in life. The Netflix star claimed she is leaving her golden age and that her birthday will be a cocktail of the highest order. In the first episode of After The Altar, Alexa announced that she will be celebrating her birthday with a party. She stated that she wanted the event to have a huge vibe. She said that the birthday celebration should be sophisticated, and exquisite.</p><p>Alexa Lemieux was born on September 28, 1994, to an Israeli-Jewish family, and is 29 years old as of 2022. Her older sister, two younger brothers, a step-sibling, and a younger sister named Emma are among her six siblings, all of whom she adores. The reality TV actress Alexa's parents separated when she was still quite little.</p><p><strong>Bartise Bowden</strong> asserts in Love Is Blind: Season 3 of The Altar was shot in August 2022. As a result, Alexa Lemieux would have been 28 years old when she appeared on the Netflix reality series to celebrate her birthday. In August of this year (in 2023), Alexa will turn 29 years old, which means the show was shot at her 28th birthday party.</p><p>Certainly, Alexa Lemieux got away with throwing the sumptuous party featured in the season three finale of After the Altar. The "Love Is Blind" star's celebration included plenty of shots, liquid nitrogen ice cream, and some spectacular attire. Speaking of her stunning <a href=# rel=noopener>dress</a>, Brennan, her companion, remarked,</p><p><strong>You're a Met Gala chic girl.</strong></p><p>The controversy surrounding Alexa Lemieux's wearing the skimpy attire in front of her dad at the party, as well as comments from admirers expressing how much the public adores her sense of style, have all surrounded her birthday dress. The Mermaid Fishtail Gown by <strong>Norma Komali</strong> is Alexa's birthday dress worth <strong>$525</strong> (<strong>£432</strong>), from Revolve.</p><p>The moment Alexa and Brennon initially met in the pods, it was clear that they clicked the finale of the first episode of this season featured a wedding ceremony, a proposal from Brennon to Alexa, and Alexa accepting the proposal. The birthday celebration for Alexa Lemieux, who is still happily married to fellow competitor Brennon Lemieux, was the main subject of After the Altar.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p>Despite various challenging times while she was a contestant, Alexa Lemieux tried her best to advance the main goal of the program. As of this writing, Alexa appears to enjoy spending time with her family; she has two gorgeous white dogs who are particularly dear to her. We wish Alexa the very best and envision a bright future for her.</p><p><strong>Visit <a href=#>Celebs In-depth</a> for more <a href=#>interesting stories</a> about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGiYpZ2olnqtscyinK6wXZe2s8DHnZiyZw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./donald-trump-calls-meghan-mccain-angry-and-obnoxious.html>&#171;&nbsp;Donald Trump Calls Meghan McCain &amp;quot;Angry and Obnoxious&amp;quot;</a>
