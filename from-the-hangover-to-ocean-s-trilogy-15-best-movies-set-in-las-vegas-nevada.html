The city of Las Vegas never fails to create a stunning backdrop for any tale and cast, from the lights of the hotels and casinos of the Strip and downtown neighbourhoods to the views of rising mountains and lonely desert.</p><p>The movies on this list contain something for every movie fan in your family, from dark dramas like Leaving Las Vegas to classics like Viva Las Vegas, brilliant <a href=#>heist movies</a> like the several Oceans 11 iterations, or comedies that need more recognition like Fools Rush In and Honeymoon in Vegas. Do you enjoy mob movies? Play Casino or, as a close second, Godfather II. Do you feel like laughing? <a href=#>The Hangover</a> is the only thing you need. Are you looking for something to make you feel things? Switch Pay It Forward on.</p><p>As a backdrop, Las Vegas has it all: the glitz and glamour of the casinos and shows, the extravagant luxury of a Las Vegas hotel, the arid landscape of the mountains and deserts, affluent neighbourhoods with mansions next to impoverished neighbourhoods with dilapidated apartments belonging to a different class, a bustling city off the strip, and the seedy underbelly of the gaming business.</p><p>February 18, 2023 update: You’ll be pleased to know that we’ve updated this list with new information and titles if you’re a fan of Sin City and the various movies that are set there.</p><p>We have a few honourable mentions to go over before we get to the list of the top films based in Las Vegas. These three films are all renowned and cherished for different reasons, but Las Vegas is only actually a small part of them. Swingers became a huge hit in 1996 and made Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn famous. The Godfather Part II is a classic movie that is generally regarded as being superior to its predecessor. It is not just one of the <a href=#>best movies</a> ever made and a major influence on the gangster/mafia genre. Finally, the <a href=#>card counting</a> technique was made popular by the <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a> and Dustin Hoffman film Rain Man. These are the top Las Vegas-based films.</p><p class=toc_title>Table Of Content</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> 21 (2008)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> Bugsy (1991)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">3</span> Casino (1995)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">4</span> Diamonds Are Forever (1971)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">5</span> Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">6</span> Fools Rush In (1997)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">7</span> Honeymoon in Vegas (1992)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">8</span> Indecent Proposal (1993)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">9</span> Leaving Las Vegas (1995)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">10</span> Ocean’s 11 (1960 and 2001)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">11</span> Pay it Forward (2000)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">12</span> Smokin’ Aces (2006)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">13</span> The Cooler (2003)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">14</span> The Hangover (2009)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">15</span> Viva Las Vegas (1964)</a></li></ul><h3><span id=21_2008>21 (2008)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/21-2008.jpg alt="movies shot in las vegas new mexico,bollywood movies shot in las vegas,indian movies shot in las vegas,hollywood movies shot in las vegas,movies about las vegas shooting,what movies were filmed in las vegas,movie that takes place in las vegas,movie that takes place in vegas,famous movies shot in las vegas,which movies are set in las vegas,is there a movie about the las vegas shooting" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>21 presents the amusing tale of a means to “cheat” Las Vegas and is loosely based on the nonfiction book Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six MIT Students Who Took Vegas for Millions by Ben Mezrich. The movie centres on Jim Sturgess’s character Ben Campbell, a quiet but intelligent college student who needs $300,000 to pay for Harvard Medical School.

Bugsy creates an opulent hotel and casino in the middle of the Nevada desert and popularises Vegas as a romantic visionary and psychotic killer.</p><p>The movie was nominated for ten Academy Awards and won two of them (Best Costume Design, Best Art Direction). In addition, Bugsy took home the Golden Globe for Best Dramatic Motion Picture.

The great Scorsese co-wrote the screenplay with Nicholas Pileggi, whose book Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas served as the inspiration for the movie. It centres on Sam “Ace” Rothstein (Robert De Niro), a <a href=#>gambling</a> specialist and handicapper who manages the activities of the Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas.</p><p>Other characters include Sam’s wife Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) and “made man” Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci). The movie beautifully portrays the look and feel of Las Vegas in the 1970s and early 1980s, as well as all the changes the city underwent at that time (from interior design to architecture). It is a monumental ode to and analysis of the storied “sin city” of Las Vegas.</p><h3><span id=Diamonds_Are_Forever_1971>Diamonds Are Forever (1971)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Diamonds-Are-Forever-1971.jpg alt="movies shot in las vegas new mexico,bollywood movies shot in las vegas,indian movies shot in las vegas,hollywood movies shot in las vegas,movies about las vegas shooting,what movies were filmed in las vegas,movie that takes place in las vegas,movie that takes place in vegas,famous movies shot in las vegas,which movies are set in las vegas,is there a movie about the las vegas shooting" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Diamonds Are Forever, the epic spy movie starring Sean Connery as the legendary secret agent James Bond, follows the debonair Ian Fleming character’s attempts to infiltrate a diamond smuggling network and the wealthy business mogul behind it. Bond must travel to Sin City to look into the criminal activity, and when he learns that his archenemy Ernst Stavro Blofeld is involved in the scheme to build a deadly laser satellite, he and Tiffany Case go undercover as smugglers.</p><p>In a famous vehicle chase sequence in the movie, Bond flees from the police while simultaneously displaying his renowned hero status as he speeds through the streets of Vegas in a Ford Mustang and then on two wheels.</p><h3><span id=Fear_and_Loathing_in_Las_Vegas_1998>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Fear-and-Loathing-in-Las-Vegas-1998.jpg alt="movies shot in las vegas new mexico,bollywood movies shot in las vegas,indian movies shot in las vegas,hollywood movies shot in las vegas,movies about las vegas shooting,what movies were filmed in las vegas,movie that takes place in las vegas,movie that takes place in vegas,famous movies shot in las vegas,which movies are set in las vegas,is there a movie about the las vegas shooting" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro play a crazy journalist and a brash lawyer who travel around Sin City in their red Chevrolet Impala convertible while high on drugs to cover a motorcycle race in the 1998 cult classic black comedy Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. The trippy <a href=#>1990s</a> movie, which is based on the Hunter S. Thompson novel of the same name, follows the exploits of a couple as they explore the Strip and its many eye-catching sights while expanding their already excessive drug use.</p><p>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas received mixed reviews when it was first published, but it is now regarded as a groundbreaking and bizarre masterpiece that brilliantly caught the spirit of Thompson’s writing and made a daring statement on the extremes of our nation.</p><h3><span id=Fools_Rush_In_1997>Fools Rush In (1997)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Fools-Rush-In-1997.jpg alt="movies shot in las vegas new mexico,bollywood movies shot in las vegas,indian movies shot in las vegas,hollywood movies shot in las vegas,movies about las vegas shooting,what movies were filmed in las vegas,movie that takes place in las vegas,movie that takes place in vegas,famous movies shot in las vegas,which movies are set in las vegas,is there a movie about the las vegas shooting" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>In the Columbia Pictures film Fools Rush, Salma Hayek plays Isabel Fuentes-Whitman and Matthew Perry plays Alex Whitman.<br>One of the all-time greatest comedies with a Las Vegas setting is Fools Rush In. A straight-laced WASP named Alex Whitman, played by Matthew Perry, is brought from New York City to Las Vegas to supervise the development of a nightclub. One night he meets fiery Mexican-American photojournalist Isabel Fuentes (Salma Hayek). Following their <a href=#>one-night stand</a>, they part ways.</p><p>Three months later, when they re-connect, Isabel breaks the news to Alex. He falls in love with her as he gets to know her and her colourful Latino family. The majority of the humour is based on their cultural contrasts as well as the lifestyle contrast with his New York City life. Alex’s parents appear on an escalator in a sight that will look familiar to anyone who has ever had a sunburn in a desert city.</p><h3><span id=Honeymoon_in_Vegas_1992>Honeymoon in Vegas (1992)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Honeymoon-in-Vegas-1992.jpg alt="movies shot in las vegas new mexico,bollywood movies shot in las vegas,indian movies shot in las vegas,hollywood movies shot in las vegas,movies about las vegas shooting,what movies were filmed in las vegas,movie that takes place in las vegas,movie that takes place in vegas,famous movies shot in las vegas,which movies are set in las vegas,is there a movie about the las vegas shooting" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Honeymoon in Vegas takes first place for a comedy set in Las Vegas thanks to a stellar Nicolas Cage, Sarah Jessica Parker, James Caan, and a plane full of skydiving Elvis impersonators, to name just a few factors. Cage plays Jack Singer, a man who promised to never get married to his mother as she lay dying. He’s been seeing Betsy (Parker) for years when the movie starts, and she wants to be married and start a family.</p><p>He suggests that they travel to Las Vegas to get married, but on the way there, Jack loses Betsy in a high-stakes poker game that was rigged.</p><p>Following a series of misadventures, Jack steals a taxi in Hawaii, gets lost in San Jose, and finally dons an Elvis costume and a parachute to literally drop in and get Betsy back. The film’s insane hilarity may be summed up in one phrase: “Flying Elvises, Utah Chapter.”</p><h3><span id=Indecent_Proposal_1993>Indecent Proposal (1993)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Indecent-Proposal-1993.jpg alt="movies shot in las vegas new mexico,bollywood movies shot in las vegas,indian movies shot in las vegas,hollywood movies shot in las vegas,movies about las vegas shooting,what movies were filmed in las vegas,movie that takes place in las vegas,movie that takes place in vegas,famous movies shot in las vegas,which movies are set in las vegas,is there a movie about the las vegas shooting" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>In 1993, everyone was debating what they would do if they were presented with the kind of proposal that the characters played by Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore in Indecent Proposal received (and there were imitations of Moore’s classic ’90s black dress in every shop). Would you accept a million bucks from someone to spend the night with them? Would your spouse or partner support this? This Las Vegas-set film, in which Robert Redford also stars, centres on that query. Never mind that the wealthy man who offered $1 million in real life most likely wouldn’t resemble Redford.</p><h3><span id=Leaving_Las_Vegas_1995>Leaving Las Vegas (1995)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Leaving-Las-Vegas-1995.jpg alt="movies shot in las vegas new mexico,bollywood movies shot in las vegas,indian movies shot in las vegas,hollywood movies shot in las vegas,movies about las vegas shooting,what movies were filmed in las vegas,movie that takes place in las vegas,movie that takes place in vegas,famous movies shot in las vegas,which movies are set in las vegas,is there a movie about the las vegas shooting" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>For his performance as a suicidal alcoholic screenwriter who travels to Las Vegas to drink himself to death in the movie Leaving Las Vegas, Nicolas Cage won the Academy Award for Best Actor.

After arriving in Las Vegas, he develops feelings for Sera, an experienced <a href=#>prostitute</a> flawlessly portrayed by Elisabeth Shue. In this heartbreaking examination of alcoholic behaviour, sadness, and loneliness, Cage’s character is resolved to die while Shue’s character is subjected to horrific gang rape and eviction.</p><h3><span id=Ocean8217s_11_1960_and_2001>Ocean’s 11 (1960 and 2001)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Oceans-11-1960-and-2001.jpg alt="movies shot in las vegas new mexico,bollywood movies shot in las vegas,indian movies shot in las vegas,hollywood movies shot in las vegas,movies about las vegas shooting,what movies were filmed in las vegas,movie that takes place in las vegas,movie that takes place in vegas,famous movies shot in las vegas,which movies are set in las vegas,is there a movie about the las vegas shooting" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Whether you prefer the 2001 remake starring George Clooney, <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a>, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, or Julia Roberts or the 1960 version starring the Rat Pack (Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., and Peter Lawford), <a href=#>Ocean’s 11</a> is a pretty perfect movie, stuffed full of stars and brimming with great music and energy in both cases.
