Family &amp;amp; Relationship Explore</h1><div id=sub-header>July 2024 · 3 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p><strong>Rachel Metz, P Rod’s prior girlfriend,</strong> has already spoken extensively about their seven-year relationship. Their romance ended during the height of the epidemic. Rachel had appeared in numerous of P Rod’s YouTube videos, as had the American skateboarder.&nbsp;They even purchased a home together, but Rachel moved out following their separation. She shared a home with Paul and his daughter Heaven. It’s been three years since their separation, and Paul hasn’t been connected to anybody new since then. He just released a Life Update video in which he viewed an old video of himself indicating he had lost interest in skateboarding. In the present, P Rod may be seen praising God for rescuing him from his predicament.</p><h2>P Rod’s Girlfriend: Who Is The Skateboarder Dating?</h2><p><strong>P Rod</strong>, an American skateboarder, hasn’t been romantically associated in a long time. He had a public split with DIY YouTuber Rachel Metz in 2020.&nbsp;Before their split, the pair had been together for seven years. Metz broke up with the skateboarder and announced it on her Instagram account.&nbsp;Metz stated that she was coping with a lot of emotions and in a video titled “DIY Tiny She Shed Workshop Makeover + Life Update,” Metz revealed that she would be leaving her and Paul’s residence on her 30th birthday.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/P-Rod-1.jpg alt="P Rod" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Since 2015, when Metz’s fan base began to build, they had only seen her with Paul. Metz has been in Paul’s YouTube videos since 2013, and the two have been dating since 2013. Rachel posted a TikTok video in October of last year, offering an update on her trailer refurbishment. She said that she started refurbishing the trailer after leaving her and Paul’s house.</p><p>She said that the trailer remodeling transformed her. Rachel discussed her relationship with Paul on the Off The Record podcast, which was taped before their breakup. Rachel had discussed the early phases of her relationship with Paul, as well as how helpful he had been throughout her life.&nbsp;Before his relationship with Rachel, Paul was in a relationship with Rainbow, with whom he had a daughter, Heaven Love.</p><h2>P Rod Family</h2><p><strong>Laura Martinez</strong>, the skateboarder’s mother, raised him. <strong>Paul Rodriguez Sr</strong>., his father, is a well-known Mexican-American actor and stand-up comedian. P-Rod’s mother was divorced by the stand-up comedian when he was just two years old. He did, however, take an active part in his son’s upbringing. But it was the wrong way, as his wife would say.</p><p>Paul Sr would attempt to purchase his son’s affection. He would shower him with numerous presents. He even got him golf equipment in the hopes of his kid being the next Tiger Woods.&nbsp;P-Rod was uninterested in golf and never used any of his father’s golf equipment. Instead, he requested that he purchase a skateboard for him. Paul Sr bought P-Rod his first skateboard as a Christmas present when he was 12 years old, and it was the finest investment he ever made.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/P-Rod-2.jpg alt="P Rod" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Paul Sr. and Laura were initially opposed to Paul surviving as a skateboarder. But he pledged to build a name for himself in the skateboarding business.&nbsp;Paul has previously shown his family, including his daughter Heaven, in a YouTube video in 2012. He spoke openly about the significance and impact of his family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGinZqqfmXqotdGlnauhlaOxbrXSZp%2BeZZSWwaq6xmaYp7Gfo7JussCmoKWxXaeyra3Toqanq5ievW6x16mjqKqVZA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./roslyn-singleton-wiki-age-height-net-worth-husband-death.html>&#171;&nbsp;Roslyn Singleton- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Husband, Death</a>
