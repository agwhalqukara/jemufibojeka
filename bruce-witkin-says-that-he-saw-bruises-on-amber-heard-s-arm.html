relationship soured after Depp’s divorce with Amber Heard.</p><p><strong>Johnny Depp’s</strong> former bandmate and friend of 40 years claimed that he saw bruises on <strong>Amber Heard’s</strong> arm, which he said looked like she had been grabbed. <strong>Bruce Witkin</strong> said that their decades-long friendship and professional relationship soured after he delivered testimony that Depp perceived as being “stabbed in the back.”</p><p>Originally recorded on Feb. 17, 2022, Witkin’s testimony was shown to a Virginia jury on Thursday, in the first of a <a href=#>series of video depositions</a> entered into evidence that day. Occasionally vaping in the middle of his questioning, Witkin touched upon themes that pervaded Heard’s case: jealousy, alcohol and drug use, and apparent signs of physical abuse. Witkin acknowledged that he never personally witnessed Depp hitting Heard, but he did identify what he described a finger-shaped bruises on her arm.</p><p>“I mean, it looks similar to that, but it didn’t look like a— It looked like a grab, not a punch, like just someone grabbed her arm,” Witkin said.</p><p>The ex-bandmate emphasized that he only noticed such a bruise “one time.”</p><p>Though Witkin could not recall a time frame of the observation, he said it coincided with their involvement in a documentary about Rolling Stones musician <strong>Keith Richards</strong>. Heard previously testified in U.K. court proceedings that Depp went on a “<a href=#>24-hour cocaine and whiskey bender</a>” before filming in 2013. A U.K. judge <a href=#>credited</a> the allegation that Depp assaulted her during that time, but Witkin described the bruise as inconsistent with being hit.</p><p>“Like I said, it just looked like she was grabbed,” Witkin said. “That’s what it seems to be finger marks.”</p><p>Asked whether he ever spoke to Heard about the marks, Witkin said: “No.”</p><p>Depp and Heard’s brief marriage officially lasted from 2015 and 2017, when their $7 million divorce settlement finalized. But Heard filed for a restraining order in May 2016, when her domestic abuse allegations first went public.</p><p>In December 2018, Heard wrote a Washington Post op-ed that alluded to those divorce proceedings but did not mention Depp explicitly. Depp sued months later in a $50 million lawsuit alleging defamation by implication. Heard countersued for Depp’s attorney’s characterization of her claims as a “hoax.”</p><p>Before those dueling defamation claims, Witkin said, his longtime friendship with Depp ended with unexplained recriminations.</p><p>“I started to feel a distance and 2017. We had a gig, and I saw him. But he was really kind of distant and kind of fucked up,” Witkin said. “And like, he wrote me this weird text saying I stabbed him in the back and badmouth him, and I’m like, ‘What are you talking about?’ He wouldn’t explain it. And pretty much I haven’t seen him since 2018.”</p><p>He said their communications ended after that.</p><p>“I just can’t get through to him,” Witkin said. “No returned texts. No nothing. No emails. My daughter even got married, and he ignored it.”</p><p>Heard accused Depp of surrounding himself with yes-men more concerned about keeping themselves in his good graces and on his payroll than acting in his best interest. Witkin hinted at that dynamic, too.</p><p>“I think there’s some people behind the scenes talking shit about me because everybody always tried to position themselves, ‘Oh, who’s the best friend and who’s this, that,’ when I was just there to be his friend,” Witkin testified. “And I think there were some lies and all this bullshit about me that he actually believed, which is surprising.”</p><p>Outside the palace intrigue of Depp’s inner circle, Watkins said, one of the Pirates of the Caribbean star’s grievances was clear.</p><p>“I know that he wasn’t happy about my testimony, but I wasn’t going to lie,” he said.</p><p>After Witkin’s testimony, Depp’s former talent agent <strong>Tracey Jacob</strong> said in her video deposition that the actor never has been accused of physically abusing a woman other than Heard.</p><p>(Screenshot via Law&Crime Network)</p><p>Have a tip we should know? <a href=#><span class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=65110c151625090412040b0106170c08004b060a08>[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX5e%2Ftq%2FEZq6irJueu26%2FwLKqZqyYlsFutMRmqpqvXZe%2FtrXSnqpmp55irq6uxKtkoZ2Rp7G0ecCrpGg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./cowboys-jerry-jones-reflects-on-not-drafting-randy-moss-was-a-big-lesson-for-me-news-scores.html>&#171;&nbsp;Cowboys' Jerry Jones Reflects on Not Drafting Randy Moss: 'Was a Big Lesson for Me' | News, Scores,</a>
