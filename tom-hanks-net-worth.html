Born July 9, 1956 to Janet Marylyn, hospital employee, and Amos Mefford Hanks, a cook, in Concord, California, he’s one of the most famous actors of our time. When his parents divorced in 1960, Hanks and several of his siblings went to live with their father in Red Bluff. He was not known for being very popular. He describes himself as a geek, going as far as to call himself a spaz and saying that was the reason other kids in school as well as his teachers did not find him particularly enjoyable. He was a loner, often spending his time by himself due to the fact that he was too shy to make friends. During his high school years, he took his awkwardness to the stage and starred in several drama productions. Being someone else was the way he coped with being so uncomfortable in his own skin throughout his school career.</p><p>Deciding to begin his college career studying theater at Chabot College, Tom Hanks later decided to transfer to California State University in Sacramento. He felt that he had nothing to do with his career except theater because he just liked to goof off and have fun. That’s when he met Vincent Dowling and became an intern for his company. He began acting in more productions at this time, winning several awards. It inspired him to move to New York City when it was just 1979. Before the year was up, he’d had a starring role in a low-budget film and a television series. However, it was not until he was cast in Bosom Buddies, a sitcom, that he moved to Los Angeles and began his career there. Two seasons later, the show was cancelled and Tom Hanks was leaning on the way of becoming a household name. His producer knew immediately he would be a huge movie star, and he was right. It was almost immediately after his show was cancelled that he had a guest appearance on a hit show called Happy Days, when producer Ron Howard called him to ask Hanks to take part in a movie he was working on.</p><p>That movie was Splash. Tom Hanks took the role alongside actress Daryl Hannah, and he became an overnight sensation. Sadly, the next decade was not kind to him. Tom Hanks had many roles, but they were not hits. They were all right, but he did not receive another role that would turn his career around until he was cast as the mean, hateful, drunken coach in a film called A League of Their Own, with some of the world’s most famous faces; Geena Davis, Madonna and Rosie O’Donnell in 1992. It was the next year he was cast in Sleepless in Seattle, followed by a movie called Philadelphia. It was only a year later that Tom Hanks was given his first Academy Award for his role in that particular movie.</p><p>By now, it’s 1994 and Tom Hanks is the most famous man in Hollywood. He began working on Forrest Gump that year. He followed that up with roles in movies such as Apollo 13, Toy Story, That Thing You Do!, Saving Private Ryan, You’ve Got Mail, The Green Mile, Toy Story 2, Cast Away, Band of Brothers, Road to Perdition, Catch Me if You Can, The Da Vinci Code and dozens more. Married to his second wife, Rita Wilson, since 1988, his son Colin Hanks is also a famous actor.</p><p>Photo by Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGirqKVdna6vt9JmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./allen-abisia-obituary-lynchburg-community-remembers-allen-adrian-abisia-after-passing-at-37.html>&#171;&nbsp;Allen Abisia Obituary, Lynchburg Community Remembers Allen Adrian Abisia After Passing at 37</a>
