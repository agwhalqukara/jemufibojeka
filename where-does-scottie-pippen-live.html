He is a six-time NBA champion for the Chicago Bulls and played alongside legends such as <a href=#>Michael Jordan</a> and <a href=#>Dennis Rodman</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Scottie Pippen lives in Los Angeles, however, there is not much information specifically where. He had houses in Chicago and Florida, both of which have been sold.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>As one of the most famous players in the modern NBA, he has earned a lot from his playing days plus endorsement deals. These afforded Pippen a few nice homes, which we’ll be touring virtually. Scroll on!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fort Lauderdale</h2><p><a href=#>Scottie</a> and his wife Larsa bought the Fort Lauderdale estate in <a href=# rel=noopener>2004</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The three-story Italian-style house has about 13,500 square feet of space, and has six bedrooms, seven bathrooms, a theater, wine cellar, gym, and a waterfront basketball court.</p><p>The property has 215 feet of waterfront with its own dock.</p><p>It was designed to have a resort feel which would not be complete without a pool, an enormous water slide, waterfalls, and fountain area. All that water fun will lead to hungry residents so there is an outdoor kitchen to get a quick fix.</p><p>The house was used for a season in the TV show, The Real Housewives of Miami, in which the couple also appeared. The property was sold in 2021 for <a href=# rel=noopener>$10.55 million</a> and will be part of Pippen’s divorce settlement.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Illinois</h2><p>Since Pippen’s relocation to Los Angeles, he has referred to his Highland Park home as more of a “vacation house.”</p><p>They acquired the 10,000-square-foot mansion in 2004 for $2.23 million. It has five bedrooms, 5-½ bathrooms, a modern kitchen, a wine cellar, and an eight-car garage.</p><p>Among the basic necessities, it also features half a basketball court, a gym, a sauna, an infinity pool, and a movie theater for <a href=# rel=noopener>Scottie to watch his favorite movie, “Die Hard”</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The 2.7-acre property was sold for just <a href=# rel=noopener>under $2 million</a> in 2021.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Family</h2><p>Scottie Pippen first married Karen McCollum in 1988 and they had a son, Antron. The marriage did not last long as the couple divorced in 1990.</p><p>He then married Larsa in 1997 and they have four children: Scotty Jr., Preston, Justin and Sophia. Scottie’s and Larsa’s divorce was filed in 2018 and finalized in 2021.</p><p>He has another daughter, Sierra, with ex-fiancee Yvette De Leon. He also has one more daughter, Taylor, with ex-girlfriend Sonya Robby.</p><p>Pippen has suffered some family tragedies in his life as a dad. Tyler, twin sister of Taylor, <a href=# rel=noopener>died days after birth</a> in 1994. His eldest child, Antron, passed away unexpectedly <a href=# rel=noopener>in 2021</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Playing Highlights</h2><p>Scottie Pippen played for Don Dyer at the University of Central Arkansas.&nbsp;</p><p>He averaged 23.6 points, 10 rebounds, and 4.3 assists as a senior, which caught the attention of NBA scouts. He was drafted fifth overall by the Chicago Bulls in the 1987 NBA Draft.&nbsp;</p><p>With his size and length, he was the perfect complementary player for Chicago’s main draw, Michael Jordan. Scottie was able to lock up guards and wing players and together they crushed ball handlers.</p><p>He was named into the NBA All-Defensive First Team eight times and twice in the Second Team.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Pippen was instrumental in the Bulls’ first three-peat. Apart from his stellar defense, he was able to initiate the offense as a primary ball-handler, taking the load off MJ’s shoulders.&nbsp;</p><p>When Jordan tried baseball in 1993, Scottie stepped up and took over as the team’s main weapon. He averaged 22 points, 8.7 rebounds, 5.6 assists, and 2.9 steals per game which led the team.</p><p>He was named All-Star Game MVP and he led the Bulls to the Eastern Conference Semifinals <a href=# rel=noopener>where they lost to the New York Knicks</a> after taking the series to seven games.</p><p>In the 1994-1995 season, he led the Bulls with 21.4 points, 8.1 rebounds, 5.2 assists, and league-best 2.9 steals. They again reached the Eastern Conference Semifinals only to lose to the Orlando Magic.</p><p>In 1996 Jordan returned to the NBA and with the addition of future hall-of-famer Dennis Rodman, the Bulls’ second three-peat was set. Scottie’s game has fully matured and he has proven that he is truly one of the game’s best.</p><p>Pippen was traded to the Houston Rockets in the 1998-1999 season. He was then traded to Portland in the 1999-2000 season.</p><p>He played his final seasons right where he started – with the Chicago Bulls. In 2005, Pippen’s jersey number was retired to the rafters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jrCfnqqVYrGwsdJmqpynpKm2pnnPoqepnZ5iuarCxGg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./outer-banks-stars-talk-about-cleo-s-future-on-the-show-after-season-2-finale.html>&#171;&nbsp;'Outer Banks' Stars Talk About Cleo's Future on the Show After Season 2 Finale</a>
